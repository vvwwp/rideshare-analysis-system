## 📊 System Architecture

### 🎯 Five Core Indicators
| Indicator | Standard | Evaluation Range |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Smoothness** | ISO 2631-1 | RMS Acceleration |
| **Stability** | Continental Research | Angular Velocity Variation |
| **Noise Level** | WHO 2018 | Environmental Noise Guidelines |
| **Time Efficiency** | Wuhan City Data | Average Travel Speed |
| **Price Performance** | Market Research | Cost per Kilometer |

### ⚖️ Dual-Layer Weight System
```
Layer 1: Traditional Entropy Weight → Objective weight based on data distribution
Layer 2: Balance Factor Correction → Eliminate scoring function sensitivity bias
Final Weight = Balance Factor × Entropy Weight (normalized)
```
